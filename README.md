# Report-Register
An excel file that uses VBA to create files, open files, create windows to interact with the user and many more.
This is my first project that started in 2010 in a company named Pemstar then changed the name to Benchmark Electronics.[Report Register (Istoria).docx](https://github.com/AlexC1980/Report-Register/files/9385393/Report.Register.Istoria.docx)
These VBA modules were created for a x64 bit Microsoft Office environment and can be used for a x86 bit if "PtrSafe" is deleted in all the modules.
This Excel file cannot be simply used if copy and paste all the data from this repository. There is more to tell about my project but I keep my file as a backup in different places.
